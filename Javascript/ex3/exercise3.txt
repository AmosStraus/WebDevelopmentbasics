// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!


var n1 = Number(prompt("First number:"));
var n2 = Number(prompt("Second number"));
var sum = n1 + n2;
var subtraction = n1 - n2;
var product = n1 * n2;
var division = n1/n2;


alert("Sum is: "+sum+"\nsubtraction is: "+subtraction);
alert("product is: "+product+"\ndivision is: "+division);
